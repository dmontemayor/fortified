Tests should be written as test_"domain"_"entity"_"testname".f90.
Tests should be self contained executables that return nothing for pass
and throw an error message when fail.
A test script called "folly" should appear in the main directory, compile the
tests if necessary, and be used to run tests with input args.
Calling folly "domain" will run all test associated to entities within the
entire domain. Current domains include core, cann, nonadmd, and ontology.
Calling folly "domain"_"entity" will run all test associated to a single entity.
Calling folly "domain"_"entity"_"testname" will run individual tests.
